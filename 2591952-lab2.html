                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>My latest project is my project for Mobile Computing course, where we had to
                    desighn a program to allow people to request and donate important items to other
                    people.  It was an interesteing experience working with many new people.  Overall 
                    I was please with the experience and am excite to work with more teams in the future.
